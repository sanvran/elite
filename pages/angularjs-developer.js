                                <p>Besides being Open-source and developed by Google, AngularJS remains a preferred JavaScript framework because of its ability to create interactive elements for single-page applications. Easier coding and testability remain benefits of hiring AngularJS developers. Applications using AngularJS include Amazon, Paypal, Gmail, Udemy, Netflix and Snapchat among many others. Hire Angular developers to create a frontend that leaves a meaningful interaction for your customers and attracts many more.</p><p></p>Frontend developers who have worked with CCS, HTML and JavaScript find AngularJS an easier framework to learn and work with. It is also a quick responsive framework that reflects any changes made in code onto the screen instantly. Thus, works on a two-way binding feature. <br />

                                            <p>Whether to use AngularJS or ReactJS is a question every frontend developer has faced every now and then. While both are open-source frameworks for frontend development of single page applications, Angular is back by Google while React was developed by Facebook. As a structural framework, AngularJS is preferred to develop dynamic web apps. React, on the other hand, allows you to build UI components being a JavaScript library itself. AngularJS uses MVC (Model View Controller) and is a typescript while React works on Virtual DOM and is based on JavaScript. When it comes to source code, Angular doesnâ€™t let your frontend developer add to JavaScript library while React does. And lastly, where ReactJS requires various set of tools to perform specific tests, AngularJS uses a single tool that provides instant testing and debugging for your complete project. Therefore, the decision web developers take with respect to these two frameworks is usually a personal opinion and never a clear indicator of which framework is better.</p>
